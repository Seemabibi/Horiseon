Working with customer, Horiseon, taking their existing website code and update it inline with HTML semantic structure.

ON THE JOB TICKET
The customer requested to be bought inline.

USER STORY:

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
So that our own site is optimised for search engines
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The main challenge I faced was understanding the structure and linking this to CSS.
